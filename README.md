# NotePad

For my **Portfolio 4 Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created a NotePad application where useres can write their to-do lists.

The Note Pad application is an application where users can jot down their tasks or cirtain things they want to achieve in a day or any time. The application is created in such a manner that users can create, view, edit and delete tasks they nolonger want to appear on their note-pad, this gives users the ability to take control of what they want to appear in their notepad.

Link to the deployed app is [here]().
