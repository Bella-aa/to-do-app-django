# NotePad

For my **Portfolio 4 Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created a NotePad application where useres can write their to-do lists.

The Note Pad application is an application where users can jot down their tasks or cirtain things they want to achieve in a day or any time. The application is created in such a manner that users can create, view, edit and delete tasks they nolonger want to appear on their note-pad, this gives users the ability to take control of what they want to appear in their notepad.

Link to the deployed app is [here]().

## Objective?

-----

The main objective is to create an interactive NotePad website that the owner as a user can engage with via an admin login system to access a database.   The website is created in such a manner that  the user can create, view, edit and delete tasks they nolonger need to appear on their to-do list.

## User Experience

Site Aims
1. To create a Note-Pad website to allow the owner to create new tasks, update existing tasks and delete accomplished tasks .
1. To allow the owner/user to create, view created tasks
1. To allow the owner/user to view or delete tasks they nolonger want
1. To allow the owner to cross out tasks they have already accomplished.
1. To allow users create new tasks
1. To allow new users to create accounts to use Note Pad
1. To allow users to delete their accounts on NotePad if nolonger needed.

## Agile Methodology

* All user stories were entered as issues in a GitHub Kanban project. The live project board can be found on the repository's project tab.

## UX Design

* *The UXD was created taking into consideration "The Five Planes"*

### Strategy plane

* Note Pad applicaction is an app where new users can create new accounts, add items to their to-do list and existing users can log in and add on tasks to their already existing account.

### Scope Plane

* The users will be able to create an account. After logging in, they will be able to add new items/tasks to the to-do list 

### Structure Plane

* Note Pad will have 4 main pages - Login page, Register page,Tasks page and Logout page.

### Skeleton Plane

* Using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/), I drew a sketch of how the app will look like, making it easy to follow a pattern while designing the website.

### Surface Plane

* The chosen color scheme picked for the website is predominantly blue, white, and purple. 
* The colors of the whole application were chosen to stand out from the main theme to get the attention of the user.
* The color contrast successfullyÂ passes using the [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/) contrast. White text over brightly coloured background contrasts well and gives good visual to the user.
